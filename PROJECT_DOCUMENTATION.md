# Epic Free Games Notifier - Client Project Documentation

> **Note:** This client project framing has been created to meet the 99x internship application requirements. The Epic Free Games Notifier was originally developed as a personal project.

## Client Information (Simulated)
**Client:** GameAlert Services (fictional)  
**Contact:** Sarah Chen, Product Manager (fictional)  
**Project Duration:** December 2024 - January 2025

## Project Overview
For the purposes of this internship application, I've created a scenario where GameAlert Services requested a solution to automatically track and notify users about free game offerings on the Epic Games Store. In this simulation, the client's business model focuses on helping gamers discover free content across multiple platforms, with Epic Games Store being their initial focus area.

## Client Requirements (Simulated)

### Functional Requirements
1. **Automated Free Game Detection**
   - System must automatically detect current and upcoming free games on Epic Games Store
   - Detection should run at least once daily to ensure timely notifications

2. **Email Notification System**
   - System must send detailed notifications about available free games
   - Emails must include game titles, descriptions, and availability periods
   - Email format should be visually appealing and mobile-friendly

3. **Reliable Execution**
   - Solution must operate with minimal maintenance requirements
   - System should include appropriate error handling and logging

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Cost Efficiency**
   - Solution must utilize free or low-cost infrastructure
   - Deployment should require minimal ongoing operational expense

2. **Scalability**
   - Design should allow for potential expansion to other game platforms
   - System architecture should support adding multiple notification channels in the future

3. **Security**
   - All authentication credentials must be securely stored
   - System must comply with email security best practices

## Solution Implementation

### Technical Architecture
The solution was implemented using Python with GitHub Actions for scheduling and automation. This approach satisfied the hypothetical client's cost efficiency requirements while providing reliable execution.

#### Key Components:
- **Data Retrieval Module**: 
  - Python script to fetch free game data from Epic Games API
  - Improved error handling for API responses
  - Type-hinted code for better maintainability
- **Notification Engine**: 
  - Email composition and delivery system using SMTP
  - Returns clear status indicators (None for errors)
- **Code Organization**:
  - PEP 8 compliant import structure
  - Separated standard library and third-party imports
  - Clear function return types and error states
- **Automation Framework**: GitHub Actions workflow for scheduled execution
- **Configuration Management**: Environment variables for secure credential storage

### Development Process
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Identified needs based on personal use case
2. **Design Phase**: Created technical architecture and component design
3. **Implementation**: Developed the solution components using Python
4. **Testing**: Performed manual and automated testing of all functionality
5. **Deployment**: Configured GitHub Actions for continuous operation
6. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive user and technical documentation

#### Recent Improvements:
- Refactored code structure following Python best practices
- Enhanced error handling for API and data processing
- Added type hints for better code maintenance
- Improved code documentation and return values

## Results (Simulated Client Feedback)

The solution successfully met all the hypothetical client requirements, providing reliable daily notifications about free games on the Epic Games Store. In this scenario, the client would be particularly satisfied with:

- The clean, informative email format
- Reliable daily operation without manual intervention
- The cost-effective implementation using GitHub Actions
- Comprehensive documentation for future maintenance

Simulated client feedback: "The Epic Free Games Notifier has exceeded our expectations. It provides exactly the functionality we needed with minimal operational overhead. The code is well-structured and the documentation makes it easy for our team to maintain."

## Future Enhancements

Based on the simulated client scenario, the following enhancements have been identified for potential future implementation:

1. Expansion to additional game platforms (Steam, GOG, etc.)
2. Integration with messaging platforms (Discord, Telegram)
3. User preference management for customized notifications
4. Web interface for managing subscriptions
